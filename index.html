    <h1>Ohio University Software Development Club</h1>

    <p>The Ohio University Software Development Club provides a space for students to collaborate in an organized manner and work on projects relating to Software Development.  We aim to have groups of students work together in teams and mimic workplace style development.  The club will assist in organizing the teams and learning both hard and soft skills.  It will also give students a platform to publish their applications and receive recognition/profits from their application (if profitable).</p>

    <p>Currently, we're working on</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A terminal user interface for <a href="https://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a>, a course management system used by Ohio University.</li>
      <li>A Twitter bot for some community interaction.</li>
      <li>Our website. (Could you tell?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But we've got more on our radar! (Radar goes here when we've learned a little more JS).</p>
    
    <canvas id="radar" width="300" height="300" >Goofy radar gag. There's a poorly animated JS radar that is blipping potential projects.</canvas>

    <p>We hold a weekly meeting on Tuesdays at 5pm in the Botanical Research Center. Stop by and get involved with some of our projects!</p>
