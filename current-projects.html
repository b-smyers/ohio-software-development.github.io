    <h1>Upcoming Projects</h1>
    <p>Upcoming projects are larger scale projects which are currently seeking members and people with interest.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>App solutions for local business</u> <a href = "https://www.colortheoryvintage.com/">Color Theory Vintage</a>. Interested in collaborating with local business?  In this project, teams ranging from 
      1 to 4 members will each create a mobile application for Color Theory Vintage.  We will present our ideas and prototypes to the CEO of Color Theory Vintage
       with intentions of deploying a full scale mobile app for the company.  Throughout this project, you will gain experience with mobile development frameworks of choice,
      such as Swift or React Native.  You will also gain experience working with real life business partners.  
      <br/> For more information, or if you are interested in joining/leading 
      a team, please reach out to Brady (<a href="mailto:bp309420@ohio.edu">bp309420@ohio.edu</a>).
      </li>
      <li><u>Garduino</u>. The garduino project combines gardening with technology.  For this project, members will work together to create a device which monitors 
      the life of a plant, and waters it when necessary.  This project will use technology such as an Arduino (or other microcontroller), which will likely run on the C 
      programming language.
      <br/> For more information, or if you are interested in joining the project, please reach out to Jude (<a href="mailto:js467820@ohio.edu">js467820@ohio.edu</a>).
